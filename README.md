# Graph Algorithms with Dijkstra's Shortest Path

This Python program demonstrates graph algorithms by implementing Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. 
It generates a graph, converts it to an adjacency matrix, applies Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest 
distance from a specified start node to all other nodes, and then displays the results.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.0

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    Use command
   git clone https://github.com/Azeem-Raza/Dijkstra-Algorithm.git

## Features

- Generates a graph with predefined edges and weights.
- Converts the graph into an adjacency matrix.
- Calculates the shortest distances from a start node using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Displays the results, excluding Node 'I'.
